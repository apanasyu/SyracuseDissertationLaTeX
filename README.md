# PhD Syracuse Dissertation LaTeX

I am attaching the LaTeX files I have used for submitting the dissertation in computer science at Syracuse University. The dissertation passed all of the format guidelines and appears on ProQuest. The University did not have a LaTeX template so maybe this will be helpful. The files were compiled using OverLeaf.
